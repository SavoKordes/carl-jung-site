        <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I have a deep personal connection to the philosophy of Carl Gustav Jung. His ideas have helped me explore some of life’s most profound questions — about identity, meaning, and the inner journey toward wholeness.
</p>

<p>
This website is a reflection of that path. I created it in the hope that it may guide others as they discover more about themselves, their inner world, and the deeper purpose behind their experiences.
</p>

<p>
Jung’s work has the power to awaken something timeless within us — and if even a small part of that speaks to you here, then this project has already fulfilled its purpose.
