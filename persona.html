        <h1>Persona: The Mask You Think You Are</h1>

        <p>In classical Latin, the word *persona* referred to the mask worn by actors in a play. 
          For Carl Gustav Jung, the term took on deeper psychological meaning: the mask we wear every day in society — 
          our roles, our labels, our curated presentation to others.</p>

        <p>The Persona is not a lie, but it is not the whole truth. It is a functional facade: teacher, parent, artist, colleague. Through it, we engage with the external world. But behind it lies the Self — far more complex and mysterious.</p>

        <h2>The Function of the Persona</h2>
        <p>We need the Persona to survive socially. It allows us to adapt to our surroundings, to communicate, to be accepted. But over-identification with the Persona can lead to spiritual hollowness — the feeling that we are merely performing life, not living it.</p>

        <h2>Peeling Back the Mask</h2>
        <p>Jung warned that clinging too tightly to one's Persona may leave the unconscious undeveloped — our Shadow, our Anima/Animus, our true individuality. True growth begins when we realize: *I am not only this mask.*</p>

        <blockquote>
          “The persona is that which in reality one is not, but which oneself as well as others think one is.”
          <br>— Carl Jung
