         <h1>The Philosophy of Carl Jung</h1></div>

<p>Jung's philosophy is based on the belief that humans are not only biological and social beings but also possess a deeply spiritual dimension. For Jung, the goal of life is not merely adaptation or happiness, but the unfolding of the true self – a process he called "individuation."</p>

<p>Central to this is the collective unconscious: a shared psychic background of all humanity, populated by archetypes – universal symbols such as the Hero, the Mother, or the Shadow. These influence dreams, myths, art, and personal development.</p>

<p>Jung emphasized the necessity of confronting the dark sides of the self – the "Shadow" – in order to become whole. The inner contrasexual dimension (Anima/Animus) and the spiritual realm also play a central role in his philosophy.</p>

<p>His approach weaves psychology, philosophy, religion, and art into a holistic understanding of the human being. For Jung, true healing is not a technical process but a deep inner transformation toward authenticity and meaning.</p>
