         <h1>The Biography of Carl Jung</h1>

<p>Carl Gustav Jung was born on July 26, 1875, in Kesswil, Switzerland. He was the son of a Protestant pastor and grew up in a religious environment, which would later influence his deep interest in mythology, religion, and the unconscious mind.</p>

<p>Jung studied medicine at the University of Basel and later specialized in psychiatry. He began working at the Burghölzli psychiatric hospital in Zurich, where he became a close collaborator of Sigmund Freud. Their intellectual partnership helped establish the foundations of psychoanalysis, but deep theoretical differences led to their eventual split.</p>

<p>Unlike Freud, Jung believed that the unconscious was not solely a reservoir of repressed desires, but also a source of creativity, wisdom, and spiritual insight. He developed the concepts of the collective unconscious, archetypes, and psychological types, which would become central to analytical psychology.</p>

<p>Jung traveled extensively, studying myths, symbols, and spiritual traditions across cultures. His work emphasized individuation—the process of becoming one’s true self—as the central goal of psychological development.</p>

<p>He continued writing and practicing until his death in 1961. Today, Jung’s ideas remain influential in psychology, psychotherapy, art, literature, and spirituality, offering a profound exploration of the inner world and the human journey toward wholeness.</p>
