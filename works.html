         <h2>The Works of Carl Jung</h2>

<p>
Carl Jung was a prolific writer whose works span psychology, mythology, religion, philosophy, and culture. His writings are often complex and symbolic, reflecting the depth of his thought and the richness of his inner life.
</p>

<p>
Among his most influential works is <em>Psychological Types</em> (1921), where he introduced the concepts of introversion and extraversion, along with his typology of thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition — a foundation for the modern MBTI system.
</p>

<p>
In <em>Symbols of Transformation</em> (1912), he began to part ways with Freud, exploring the symbolic language of the psyche and the power of myth and dreams. This marked the beginning of his theory of individuation.
</p>

<p>
His later work, <em>The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious</em> (1959), expands on his central idea that the unconscious is shared among all humans and expresses itself through recurring symbols — archetypes — found in myths, dreams, and art.
</p>

<p>
<em>Answer to Job</em> (1952) is one of his most provocative works, where Jung explores the nature of evil and humanity’s relationship with the divine. It reflects his willingness to challenge dogma and engage spiritual questions directly.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps most personal is <em>The Red Book</em>, a visual and literary record of Jung’s inner journey during a period of intense introspection. Kept private for decades, it was published posthumously and reveals the visionary core of his work.
</p>

<p>
Jung’s collected works comprise 20 volumes, encompassing essays, seminars, letters, and analytical writings. Together, they form a comprehensive map of the human psyche — a lifelong effort to bridge the rational and the mystical, the conscious and the unconscious.
